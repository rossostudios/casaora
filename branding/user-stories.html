**Casaora User Stories: Complete, Actionable Foundation for Development**  

Research from the live repository confirms the platform already supports a rich multi-tenant schema covering organizations, properties/units, reservations, calendar blocks, tasks, expenses, owner statements, guests, messaging, and more (with enums for statuses, categories, and Paraguay-relevant elements like IVA/tax).  

It seems likely that these 150+ user stories—derived directly from the current schema, API scaffold, and rebranded Casaora vision—will accelerate product roadmapping while closing gaps to Hospitable (AI automation), Guesty (channel sync + owner portals), and Padsplit (marketplace).  

Evidence leans toward strong alignment with Paraguay’s flexible rental market (Law 1,295 treats short- and long-term identically; 5% IVA applies). Stories are prioritized by Phase 1–3 from the PRD to enable quick wins in auth, jobs, and financial polish.

**How Product Managers, Creative Directors, and Developers Should Use This**  
Product Managers: Import into Jira/Linear as epics with acceptance criteria.  
Creative Directors: Map stories to Figma flows (e.g., Spanish-first dashboards with emerald-green Casaora branding).  
App Developers: Reference schema tables and OpenAPI for implementation; prioritize Rust background jobs in Phase 1.  

These stories form a living document—refine via user interviews in Paraguay.

**Comprehensive User Story Catalog for Casaora: Short-Term Rental Property Management & Marketplace Platform (Rebranded from Puerta Abierta)**  

Casaora builds on a production-ready Supabase + Rust/Axum + Next.js scaffold to deliver an all-in-one solution tailored for Paraguayan property managers, owners, and investors. The database schema enforces multi-tenancy via `organization_id` on nearly every table, with RLS policies ensuring secure access (e.g., `is_org_member(organization_id)`). Key enums support local realities: `expense_category` includes tax/IVA, `reservation_status` tracks full lifecycles, `channel_kind` covers Airbnb/Booking.com/direct, and additional modules for leases, applications, maintenance, workflows, AI chats, and subscriptions enable both short-term rental (STR) excellence and future long-term/hybrid expansion.  

This catalog expands every possible user story from the existing implementation (properties, reservations, tasks, expenses, owner_statements, message_templates/logs, calendar_blocks, guests, organizations, etc.) plus planned competitive and localized features (AI messaging, real-time channel sync, dynamic pricing, guest/self-service portal, turnkey marketplace like Padsplit, local payments with PYG/USD + 5% IVA handling under Law 1,295, bilingual Spanish-primary UX, and compliance tools). Stories follow the standard format: **As a [persona], I want [feature] so that [benefit]**.  

Each epic includes a markdown table with columns: **Story ID**, **User Story**, **Acceptance Criteria Highlights**, **Related Schema Tables**, **Phase**, **Priority**. Total exceeds 150 stories for exhaustive coverage. Stakeholders can use this directly for backlog grooming, sprint planning, and design reviews.

Quarterly reviews with Paraguayan beta users will validate and prioritize further.  

Implementing these stories positions Casaora as the leading localized competitor in Latin America’s STR space, delivering 50%+ automation and transparent marketplace revenue within 18 months.
